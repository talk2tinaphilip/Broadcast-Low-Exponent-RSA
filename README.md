# Broadcast-Low-Exponent-RSA
The aim of the project is to study RSA algorithm and possible attacks on the algorithm in detail. The project deals with solving a mathematical attack called ‘Broadcast Low Public Exponent’ attack on RSA cryptosystem by implementing Chinese Reminder Theorem. The implementation was successful by getting the plain text as the output.
